But is coffee good for you? The answer is yes, but it depends on how much you drink and what you put in it. </p>

        <p>But before you start drinking coffee by the gallon, it's important to remember that too much coffee can have negative effects on your health. Drinking too much coffee can lead to insomnia, anxiety, and heart palpitations. It can also cause stomach problems and raise your blood pressure. So, if you're going to drink coffee, it's best to do so in moderation.</p>

        <p>And remember, what you put in your coffee matters, too. Adding sugar, cream, and flavored syrups can turn a healthy drink into a calorie bomb. So, if you're going to drink coffee, it's best to drink it black or with a splash of milk or cream.</p>

        <p>So, is coffee good for you? The answer is yes, but it's important to drink it in moderation and watch what you put in it. If you do that, you can enjoy the health benefits of coffee without the negative side effects.</p>
